This mod stops players being able to silently swap guns by dragging them onto the ground and into their hands.

Whenever the player drags a gun onto the ground it makes a sound, and when they drag a gun from the vicinity GUI into their hands it also plays a sound.

Players nearby can hear these sounds, so this mechanic can't be exploited by players to secretly change guns in silence in CQB.

Hopefully the DayZ devs patch this in the future, but for now this is one solution. It's not a perfect solution and there is probably a better way to do what I've done here, but I made it for my own servers and figured I might as well release it publicly for others to use and/or learn from.

I recommend using it alongside JAD's AimSounds mod which makes a sound audible to nearby players whenever a player aims their weapon.

If you use Dab's InventoryMoveSounds mod you probably don't need this one. This mod is only specific to gun movements while InventoryMoveSounds covers all inventory movements.

Intallation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys, and then once you run your server with the mod installed the mod will automatically generate the default json config file in your server profile folder under Zenarchist/ZenGunMoveSoundsConfig.json.

The config just allows you to enable/disable sounds for other items besides guns (this option is enabled by default).

This mod must be installed on both the server & client.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
